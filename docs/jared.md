## GRV9519ZWAX44-B-23 (Smart 4 plus)

### Security
 - ðŸŸ¡ Busybox upgrade to 1.35.0
   - âœ… build S4 Plus engineer firmware requested by CL (done)
   - âœ… [06/01] Activated SIP in Router mode, then switch to DSL modem mode, there are lots of "waitting for arc-sip ready" and could not reset to default. The upgradion should not be a factor to cause this problem.
   - âœ… [06/06] Smart 4 Plus: finished. all looking good.
   - ðŸŸ¢ [06/06] Smart 4 MS: conducting

### Hybrid
 - ðŸŸ¢ EtherWAN refused to up
   - [7/06] Case 1: doesn't return TRUE during hybrid condition checking in AWD_CheckIsPermitUp(). (JC reported)
     > Add more debug message to check while AWD_CheckIsPermitUp doesn't return TRUE.

   - [7/07] Case 2: refused due to the previous link down event was ignored. (Morgan reported)
     > DSL down event was conducting, therefore Ethnet down event was ignored.
     > Do usleep and retry.

   - [7/07] Case 3: mng_action doesn't take action.
     > AWD_DBG("link_up %s\n", wan_linktype_num_str[WAN_UPLINK_TYPE_ETHERNET]);
     > mng_action("link_up", wan_linktype_num_str[WAN_UPLINK_TYPE_ETHERNET]);

     > debug mng_action ??

   - [7/12] debug AWD_TID invalided

     > Add more debug message in midcore.

     > [7/14] Log with 10M(30M) file size has 6550(106417) times cfg get return MID_FAIL. It could be a generic issue in Midcore function mapi_opt_trans().

### HPQC
 - [HPQC 20290/20291/20292][BBTC][Data] In case the VoIP functionality is deactivated the "Active Services"-list is not updated immediately (reboot necessary)
   - ðŸŸ¢ [06/16] arc-sip closed udp socket, but netstat still listed it. possible way to speed up the reclaiming of closed port ? Answer: no way to speed up
   - ðŸš« [6/21] could not reproduce anymore
### Tethering
### Active Service
  - âœ… [7/13] Fix active service lists for WAN/LAN are blanked when WAN interface is down
### VPN
 - ðŸ“Œ [6/22] create more than one tunnels on the same smartphone. After connected and disconnected to server. The connection status on HG could be wrong.
### Smarthome
 - âœ… [7/13] update bootstrap to 2.3.20 (due to awk command syntax)
      > Currently, v1.x.x still used.

### Tethering
#### ðŸŸ¢ Build Tethering software stacks
 - ðŸ”´ [7/05] Build usbmuxd recipe for iPhone
     > skip due to GPL-3.0

#### Implementation
 - ðŸŸ¡ study how to fit in the LTE dongle status pulling/notifying
   - HAL client/Server to detect tethering link state
     > use inotify to watch /sys/class/net, if new interface, e.g., usb0 created, new folder /sys/class/net/usb0 was created, too.
	 
	 > âœ… [7/14] inotify PoC failed, it doesn't support sysfs pseudo fs.

     > ðŸŸ¢ [7/14] try to use libudev.

     > get Class/SubClass/Protocol via file /sys/class/net/usb0/device/bInterfaceClass, bInterfaceSubClass, bInterfaceProtocol.

   - tethering ccsp component and data model
   - wanmanager policy modification

#### Questions
   - ðŸ“Œ [7/05] Try to turn on usbmuxd for iPhone
        > usbmuxd was skipped: it has incompatible license(s): GPL-3.0		

        > How to enable GPL-3.0 recipes?

   - âœ… [6/28] wanmanager policy
		> Currently, wan manager enforces AUTOWAN_MODE policy	
        > s_xsun: actually we are defining the new DM of WanManager... I guess there will be new Policies to be supported. But to be honest I have no idea about the usb tethering now... because it is not yet supported by RDK-F at all.
