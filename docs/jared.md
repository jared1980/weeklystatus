### Hybrid
 - ðŸŸ¢ EtherWAN refused to up
   - [7/06] Case 1: doesn't return TRUE during hybrid condition checking in AWD_CheckIsPermitUp(). (JC reported)
     > Add more debug message to check while AWD_CheckIsPermitUp doesn't return TRUE.

     > [7/21] tid issue??

   - [7/07] Case 2: refused due to the previous link down event was ignored. (Morgan reported)
     > DSL down event was conducting, therefore Ethnet down event was ignored.

### Tethering
#### ðŸŸ¢ Build Tethering software stacks
 - ðŸ”´ [7/05] Build usbmuxd recipe for iPhone
     > skip due to *GPL-3.0 or GPL-2.0*

#### Implementation
 - ðŸŸ¡ study how to fit in the LTE dongle status pulling/notifying
   - HAL client/Server to detect tethering link state
     > use inotify to watch /sys/class/net, if new interface, e.g., usb0 created, new folder /sys/class/net/usb0 was created, too.

	 > âœ… [7/14] inotify PoC failed, it doesn't support sysfs pseudo fs.

     > ðŸŸ¢ [7/14] try to use libudev.

     > get Class/SubClass/Protocol via file /sys/class/net/usb0/device/bInterfaceClass, bInterfaceSubClass, bInterfaceProtocol.

   - tethering ccsp component and data model
   - wanmanager policy modification

#### Questions
   - ðŸ“Œ [7/05] Try to turn on usbmuxd for iPhone
        > usbmuxd was skipped: it has incompatible license(s): *GPL-3.0 or GPL-2.0*

        > How to enable GPL-3.0 recipes?

   - âœ… [6/28] wanmanager policy
		> Currently, wan manager enforces AUTOWAN_MODE policy
        > s_xsun: actually we are defining the new DM of WanManager... I guess there will be new Policies to be supported. But to be honest I have no idea about the usb tethering now... because it is not yet supported by RDK-F at all.
